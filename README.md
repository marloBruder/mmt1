# mmt1

mmt1 is a mmj2 style proof assistant for the metamath formal language, created using [Tauri 2.0](https://v2.tauri.app). With it you can create not just metamath proofs, but also entire (grammatical) metamath databases.

## Installation

## Features

## Guides

If you are already familiar with mmj2 or yamma, I recommend reading [migration.md](guides/migration.md). As noted at the beginning of that guide: If you are unfamiliar with both mmj2 and yamma, I recommend watching David A. Wheelers video [Introduction to Metamath and mmj2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rst2hZpWUbU) and then come back to the migration guide. A full guide to metamath and mmt1 will hopefully be created in the future.
